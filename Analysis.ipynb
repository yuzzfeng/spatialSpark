    "# The Data\n",

    "We are going to use 2 main datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Boundaries/Urban footprints of some of the largest cities in Europe along with the total population for 2013 for those urban areas.\n",
    "2. OpenStreetMap points of interests that have culturally relevant tags\n",
    "\n",
    "## EuroStat\n",
    "\n",
    "European Commission's agency \"Eurostat\" conducted a Cities (Urban Audit) which is a Data Database containing detailed year-by-year statistics based on objective measurements. They have an incredibly rich and valuable database. The data set we are using defines cities in terms of two distinct areas (with possibly a third area - \"Kernel\" - for large cities like London and Paris). The regions are \"Core City\" and \"Large Urban Zone\". There is a great article that explains this in detail (Cities explained by EuroStat)[http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/European_cities_-_spatial_dimension] This is extremely important for our analysis as we want to do spatial analysis bounded by a well defined region whose population can be reliable defined. The EuroStat Database will give us this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Getting Spatial Boundary Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Just spend 5 minutes looking at the database for Urban Audit and try to download 2013 population data for European cities. http://bit.ly/eurostat-urban-audit-database WARNING: you can get lost on their website and emerge 2 hours later wondering where all the time went.\n",
    "\n",
    "## OpenStreetMap/Overpass API\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Cultural data we are going to use OpenStreetMap. Now there are many ways to obtain OSM data. we will use the Overpass Turbo. Overpass turbo is a web based data mining tool for OpenStreetMap. You find it at http://overpass-turbo.eu. It runs any kind of Overpass API query and shows the results on an interactive map. The source code is found on https://github.com/tyrasd/overpass-turbo. A huge thanks goes to Roland who created the Overpass API, without which this tool wouldn't exist. The Overpass API (formerly known as OSM Server Side Scripting, or OSM3S) is a read-only API that serves up custom selected parts of the OSM map data. It acts as a database over the web: the client sends a query to the API and gets back the data set that corresponds to the query. Unlike the main API, which is optimized for editing, Overpass API is optimized for data consumers that need a few elements within a glimpse or up to roughly 100 million elements in some minutes, both selected by search criteria like e.g. location, type of objects, tag properties, proximity, or combinations of them. It acts as a database backend for various services. See [Overpass API Wiki page](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Overpass API to download POI data of cultural relevance. To understand the Overpass API have a look at the quick Overpass query language guide here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Language_Guide \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: Getting to know OSM Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Just spend 5-10 minutes looking at Overpass API. Try to Query datasets like all the museums. To gain a better understanding of the OSM Tags and meanings behind them look at the Tag Features Wiki pages via Tag Info Website: http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys If you are interested in reading more about a key you can click on it then go to wiki tab an click on the wiki page in your language of choice. *Hint* there is a link to the Turbo Overpass page on the site too.\n",

    "# What are we going to do?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a data processing pipeline that takes our data sources performs aggregations by precise boundaries. Then run a weighted algorithm to calculate a \"cultural\" score for each city normalized by its total population. So the pipeline is something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/sketch.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean by culture/cultural score?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a completely subjective and our algorithm is therefore only meant as an excuse to have fun learning PySpark and Spatial Analysis. We collect data from OpenStreetMap that seems culturally relevant. These include the following tags:\n",
    "\n",
    "    tourism\"=\"artwork\"\n",
    "    tourism\"=\"gallery\"\n",
    "    amenity\"=\"theatre\"\n",
    "    amenity\"=\"arts_centre\"\n",
    "    tourism\"=\"museum\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also assign different weights to each tag. From 1 to 5. The tags above are listed from highest (artwork) to lowest (museum). This should make our analysis interesting. We will calculate a score by performing a weighted count for each of the sites found per city. Finally we will normalize our count by dividing it by the total population of the city."
